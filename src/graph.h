/**
 * graph.h
 *
 * Handles graphs representing maps.
 *
 * A graph is a common data structure used to represent networks. It is
 * completely determined by its vertices (or nodes) and the edges (or links)
 * between the nodes.
 *
 * In our case, we represent a grid map by a graph whose nodes are exactly the
 * cells that are top-free (i.e. the tile is occupied and the tile above it is
 * not occupied), meaning that we can "move" on this cell. Also, there is an
 * edge between two tiles if it is possible to move from one to the other.
 *
 * The interest of representing a map by a graph is that one can, in
 * particular, compute a walk between two cells in the map.
 *
 * The module provides four data structures:
 *
 * - `struct graph_node`: a node in the graph
 * - `struct graph`: a graph
 * - `struct graph_walk`: a walk (directed path) from one cell to another in
 *   the graph
