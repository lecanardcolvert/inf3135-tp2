/**
 * map_graph.h
 *
 * Handles graphs representing maps.
 *
 * A graph is a common data structure used to represent networks. It is
 * completely determined by its vertices (or nodes) and the edges (or links)
 * between the nodes.
 *
 * In our case, we represent an isometric map by a graph whose nodes are
 * exactly the cells that are free (i.e. there is no cell above the tile),
 * meaning that we can "move" on this cell. Also, there is an edge (a link)
 * between two cells if it is possible to move from one cell to the other. The
 * interest of representing a map by a graph is that one can, in particular,
 * compute a path between two cells in the map.
 *
 * The module provides four data structures:
 *
 * - `struct map_cell`: a cell in the map
 * - `struct map_cell_node`: a node in the graph
 * - `struct map_graph`: a graph
 * - `struct map_path`: a path from one cell to another in the graph
